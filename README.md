## The Goal 
I have created this repository to learn #Kotlin, and to try to replicate a clean architecture with that language.

## Usage of the Code
Here you have a fully functional application, you can use it to learn how I have solved some problems or to take a look to how you could build the architecture of your App. So, don't use this code to publish your self App.

## Contributions
If you think that you can improve anything of the repo, please feel free to create a pull-request.

## Acknowledgments
To everyone who with his comments, tweets or criticisms have do possible this repository, and I will like to do a mention to the Spanish community, they are always there to help me.

A special mention to [Antonio Leiva](https://antonioleiva.com/), who with his book "Kotlin for Android Developer" let me to discover this awesome language and a new programming paradigm.
